								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/btc.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The rise of Bitcoin as a significant financial asset has brought forth its potential 
									impact on traditional stock markets. This project delves into predicting Bitcoin prices, 
									contributing to a profound understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping contemporary 
									financial markets. The study employs machine learning techniques, primarily utilizing the 
									historical Bitcoin-GBP data spanning from January 1st, 2015, to September 1st, 2023. By harnessing 
									artificial neural networks and ensemble models, the project unveils invaluable insights into the 
									volatile financial landscape. Four models – Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
									network, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor – were developed to predict 
									Bitcoin prices. The top two performers, MLP and Random Forest, from both artificial neural networks 
									and ensemble models were selected and optimized for future price predictions, yielding promising 
									results exceeding 99% accuracy. Despite these promising outcomes, limitations include model overfitting, 
									sensitivity to data variability, and potential overestimations.</p>

								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/imagerecognition.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This project delves into the comparative performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models 
									for handwritten character recognition using the EMNIST dataset. The analysis demonstrates that CNNs consistently outperform MLPs in 
									terms of accuracy and robustness using different hyperparameter tuning configurations. CNNs exhibited superior accuracy compared to MLPs, 
									achieving an overall test accuracy of 87.88%, surpassing MLP's 83.65%. CNNs effectively captured spatial information from handwritten images, 
									enabling them to accurately identify characters. MLPs however, struggled with image data due to their inherent limitations in processing spatial features, 
									leading to lower accuracy. CNNs, hence, are computationally demanding and require large amounts of data for training, posing challenges for resource-constrained 
									environments. While MLPs are versatile in handling tabular data, CNNs emerge as the preferred choice for image classification tasks, particularly in scenarios 
									requiring high accuracy and robustness. The choice between MLPs and CNNs depends on the specific nature of the problem and the available resources.</p>

										<span class="subheading">Delving into the Mountain Car MDP (Deep SARSA Approach)</a></h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mountaincar.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Navigating the intricate world of reinforcement learning (RL), I delved into the Mountain Car 
									MDP(Markov Decision Process), utilizing the OpenAI Gym library and employing the deep SARSA algorithm. 
									This challenging environment presents two distinct modes: discrete and continuous, with our implementation
									focusing on the discrete version. Within this simulated realm, a car occupies the base of a sinusoidal valley, 
									its sole means of propulsion being acceleration. This acceleration can be applied in any direction through a 
									predefined set of deterministic actions: accelerating left, not accelerating, or accelerating right. Employing 
									the deep SARSA technique, the car's behavior was shaped through a combination of exploration and exploitation, 
									gradually learning to navigate the valley's treacherous slopes and ultimately reach the desired goal. 
									This journey of learning and adaptation exemplifies the power of RL in tackling complex sequential decision-making tasks.</p>

										<span class="subheading">Navigating the Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff</a></h3>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/bandit.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Delving into the intriguing landscape of multi-armed bandits (MABs), this project explores 
									the delicate balance between exploration and exploitation, a fundamental dilemma in reinforcement 
									learning (RL). The ε-greedy algorithm, a well-established approach, is meticulously examined, 
									contrasting its performance against a simple greedy method.	The ε-greedy algorithm, guided by a 
									tunable parameter ε, deftly navigates this trade-off. With a higher ε, it prioritizes exploration, 
									venturing into uncharted territories to gather new information, while a lower ε shifts the focus 
									to exploitation, maximizing rewards by sticking to proven strategies.	Comparing the ε-greedy 
									algorithm to the greedy method, where exploitation dictates every decision, the results unequivocally 
									favor the ε-greedy approach. This consistent superiority stems from the algorithm's ability to balance 
									exploration and exploitation, gradually accumulating knowledge while simultaneously reaping the benefits 
									of known good actions.	The ε-greedy algorithm's performance is subtly influenced by ε, with a lower ε 
									fostering more exploration and a higher ε promoting greater exploitation. This sensitivity highlights the 
									algorithm's adaptability, allowing it to dynamically adjust its behavior based on the specific context.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/classifiers.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>In the realm of machine learning, supervised learning methodologies for binary classification represent algorithms 
									that skillfully categorize new observations into one of two distinct classes. This project embarked on an in-depth 
									evaluation of the performance of three prominent supervised learning approaches when applied to binary classification 
									problems. The objective is to gain a refined understanding of both the strengths and drawbacks of each classification 
									method when employed to categorize a dataset containing data from two classes: class 0 and class 1. Three binary 
									classification techniques are meticulously implemented in this endeavor: K-nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and 
									Logistic Regression.</p>

								<p>
									The perceptron algorithm, a cornerstone of neural network architecture, stands as a fundamental tool 
									for binary classification tasks. This algorithm, composed of two layers – input and output – interconnected 
									by weighted connections, strives to delineate a linear decision boundary capable of effectively separating two 
									distinct classes. Through an iterative adjustment of weights and a bias term, the perceptron, equipped with a 
									signed linear activation function, endeavors to achieve this objective. This project delves into the intricacies 
									of the perceptron algorithm, culminating in its implementation from scratch.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/vote.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Demonstrated an expertise in designing and implementing robust voting algorithms to 
									address a variety of decision-making scenarios. These algorithms effectively determine 
									the winning alternative amidst a group of agents with distinct preference orderings. 
									Each individual agent possesses a unique ranking of alternatives, denoted as ≻, where α ≻ β 
									signifies the agent's preference for α over β. A preference profile encompasses n preference orderings, 
									one for each agent, capturing the collective preferences of the group. For instance, in a voting scenario 
									involving 4 agents and 4 alternatives, a potential preference profile could be as follows:<br />

									Agent 1: α≻γ≻β≻δ<br />
									Agent 2: α≻β≻δ≻γ<br />
									Agent 3: γ≻β≻α≻δ<br />
									Agent 4: β≻α≻δ≻γ.<br />
									
									A voting rule functions as a mechanism that translates the preferences of the agents into a single winning alternative.</p>
